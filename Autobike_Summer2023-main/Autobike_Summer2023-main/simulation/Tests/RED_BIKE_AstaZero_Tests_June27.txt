RED BIKE TESTS at AstaZero
June 27th 2023
__________________________

NB : - The test numbers correspond to the ones on the doc you prepared before the tests.
- All the tests were done with kp=3,75 and kd=3,5
- The tests for 2,4m/s might not be valid, as we did not change the matrixes
__________________________


----SPEED 3m/s----------
We started with a speed of 3m/s which is 8,6rd/s.


Test 1 : BALANCING with 0 roll ref 
~ 11:18 -Data1

Test 2 : BALANCING with disturbances
~ 11:26 -Data2

Test 3 with 5 deg angle
~ 11:30 +5deg (right) -Data3
~ 11:32 -5deg (left) -Data4
The circles get smaller and smaller

Test 5 : TRAJECTORY straight line
~ 11:40 -Data5
Lateral error of ~1m (peak to peak)

Test 6 with a 4-meter offset
~ 11:47 -Data6

Test 7 : straight line with a 10 deg turn after +/-35m
~ 11:54 : right -Data7
~ 11:56 : left -Data8
Aggressive heading change

Test 8 : straight line and jump
~13:45 --> something strange in the closest point -Data9
13:56 : right -Data10
~14:04 : left -Data11

Test 9 : straight line then circle
~14:12 : 2 laps -Data12 Jump GPS
~14:26 : 3 laps -Data13

Test 10 : infinity 30m
~14:36 : fail -Data14
~14:40 : 3+ laps -Data15

Infinity 35m 
~14:51 : only 1 lap, had to stop bc it was going to crash on the wall -Data16


----SPEED 2,4m/s----------
!!!!The results might not be valid because we used the same matrixes as for the 3m/s speed!!!!
Corresponds to 6,86rd/s for the radius of 0,35m

Circle with 2,4m/s speed
~15:03 : 3 laps -Data17
Lateral error <0.5m (or 1m peak to peak)
The trajectory is better for a higher speed, but it is the opposite for the balance.

Infinity 30m with 2,4m/s speed 
~15:11 : 2 laps -Data18
GPS jump always at the same area ?

Green bike: 
1- Balancing control. -Data 19
2- Straight line trajectory. -Data20
3- Circle 3 laps. -Data21
