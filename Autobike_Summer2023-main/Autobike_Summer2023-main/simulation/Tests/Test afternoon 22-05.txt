Fare test per controllare il roll, per vedere se effettivamente la parte positiva eÂ´ quando si muove verso destra oppure no. Magari stand still test. Fare un test per vedere per controllare gli errori (lateral error and heading error). Fare un test come quello mostrato dal professore, in alto a sinistra e quello centrale.
