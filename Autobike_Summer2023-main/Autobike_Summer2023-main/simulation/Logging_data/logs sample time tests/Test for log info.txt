Test for log files: 
-data(1) Manual CPU selection and all sample rate to 0.01. All priorities to 100.
-data(2) Manual CPU selection and all sample rate to 0.01 instead of log loop 0.1. Priority default.
-data(3) Automatic CPU selection and all sample rate to 0.01 instead of log loop 0.1. Priority default.
-data(4) Sam test as before we put frequency of the GPS with U-Center at 33Hz, probably the highest possible. Logging to 100000.
-data (5) GPS configuration at 33Hz. Logging to 50000 on Labview
-data (6) GPS configuraion at 33Hz. Logging to 10000 on Labview
-data (7) GPS configuration at 10Hz (0.1s). Logging to 50000 (0.05s) on Labview
-data (8) GPS configuration at 10Hz. Logging to 10000 (0.01s) on Labview
-data (9) GPS configuration at 10Hz. Logging to 200000 (0.2s) on Labview.
-data (10) GPS configuration at 10Hz. Logging to 100000 (0.1s) on Labview.
-data (11) disconnect GPS log, also the flag, from Labview and put zero. Logging to 10000 (0.01s) on Labview.
-data (12) GPS frequency to 2Hz, logging on Labview 10Hz.
-data (13) GPS frequency to 10 Hz, comment out all the visualization part except to log write. Logging in Labview to 0.01.DATA GOOD! The problem was the visualization part.
-data (14) Same test before, comment out all the CPU block.
-data (15) //, comment out all instead of CPU block.
-data (16) Transfer all the part of visualization in the part of position check and work to a 10 Hz frequency, the logging is working to 100Hz.
-data GPS 10Hz visualization at 10000 us (0.1s)

Manual CPU means, all the treads on CPU 0, instead of log loop CPU 1.
