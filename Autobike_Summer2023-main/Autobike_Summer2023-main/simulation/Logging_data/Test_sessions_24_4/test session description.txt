test 1: 
line, no motor, no steering
walk to offset to 6 meters (to right)
little error1 contribution

test2
same as 1 but other direction (to left)

test3
velocity 1.5
walk, motor on, trajectory on.

test4
same as 3 with 2ms

test5
only balancing 0.015 rollref offset
With motors
only balancing (no traj)
2ms

test6
same as 5

test 7
stand still with adjusted q and r for delta

test8
same as 5 and 6 but with different q and r

test9
same as 8

test 10
rollofset 0
With motors
only balancing (no traj)

test 11
standstill rollcheck

test 12
rollofset -0.02
With motors
only balancing (no traj)

test 13
trajectory ON again
with k1 *100
without motors(just walk)

test 14
trajectory ON again
with k1 *10
without motors(just walk)

test 15
trajectory ON again
with k1 *10
with motors on again

test 16
same as 15
negate rollref from traj
with motors on again
